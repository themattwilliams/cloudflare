                    <p>DDoS attacks have the ability to bring important parts of the internet to a screeching halt, and they are getting larger. In October of 2016 the East Coast Dyn servers experienced what is likely the largest DDoS attack of all time. The attack affected their ability to provide domain name traffic to key sites such as The New York Times, Reddit, and Github. So what is DDoS exactly?</p>

                    <p>A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is a type of malicious attack designed to interrupt regular Internet traffic. A nefarious actor floods a target victim’s web presence with distributed http requests from thousands of locations, locking out any and all regular requests.</p>

                    <p>A similar effect can happen naturally in times of extraordinary traffic. Many high traffic Internet services are designed to receive more visitors then they usually encounter, but if Taylor Swift drops the latest hottest single, it might be the case that the service distributing the music doesn’t have the bandwidth to deal with all the traffic it receives, taking the server offline for the music-hungry customers. DDoS attacks attempt to achieve a similar result intentionally by building what is known as a botnet.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Common Paths to building a botnet: Worms, Trojans, and Zombies, oh my!</h2>

                    <p>(Graphic of an oversized worm, a wooden horse, and a zombie)</p>

                        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/900x700.jpg" alt="">
                    </a>

                    <p>Common methods of DDoS aim at disrupting either network/transport-level or application-level of a victim. Examples of network-level flooding attacks include exhausting the bandwidth, router capacity or network resources of the victim.  Application-level attacks aim to disrupt a user’s service by exhausting server resources like sockets, CPU, memory, and disk/database bandwidth.</p>

                    </a>

                    <p>In order to attack a victim with as many devices as possible in a coordinated fashion, attackers set up attack armies called botnets. These botnets consist of “Zombies” — infected computers or devices that operate together for a single purpose. Zombies are often recruited through various exploits including worms, Trojan horses, or backdoors. By eliciting large pools of infected machines and IOT Devices, DDoS attacks are able to reach new heights of Internet traffic, making it difficult for the victim to combat the sheer volume of malicious requests, potentially drowning out legitimate traffic.</p>

                    <blockquote>“Defending a small site is really hard… [the client’s] origin server could maybe handle around 20 queries per second. We saw attacks of up to 450,000 queries per second. How do you deal with that?” 

                    - Google Security Reliability Engineer Damian Menscher talking about a DDoS attack.
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>With increasing numbers of vulnerable IOT devices available to be turned into zombies, the problem of DDoS isn’t going away anytime soon. Recently, traffic from a DDoS attack has been seen at record level of over 1 tbps, which is enough to cripple many services. In late 2016, a French hosting provider by the name of OVH receives such an attack, which was largely powered by poorly configured or vulnerable IOT devices such as CCTV cameras.</p>


                    <p>While the malicious tools have improved, so have the ways of defending against them. There are ways to improve a site’s ability to withstand the force of a DDoS attack.
